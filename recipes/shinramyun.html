<h2>description</h2>
<p>in this recipe i will be showing you how i make shin ramyun</p>
<p>this is a good meal for when you want to eat something hot and salty and soupy that's quick and easy to make</p>

<h2>ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 packet shin ramyun</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>ha that's it</li>
</ul>

<h2>steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>boil a pot of water. not too much bc you don't want your soup to be too diluted</li>
    <li>when water is boiling, add noodles in</li>
    <li>allow noodles to cook in the boiling water, occasionally stirring and seperating the noodles</li>
    <li>push the noodles to the side and add seasoning packet into water. stir until all seasoning is dissolved</li>
    <li>before noodles are fully cooked, push them to the side again and crack an egg into the soup. i prefer to turn down before doing this so you don't get huge boiling bubbles of water and your egg also doesn't cook so quickly, so you can still get a nice runny yolk</li>
    <li>allow contents of pot to sit for a while longer for noodles to soften as desired and for egg to cook</li>
    <li>remove pot from stove and eat!!</li>
</ol>
