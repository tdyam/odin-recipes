<h2>description</h2>
<p>ok this is actually a misleading photo bc the coffee that i make doesn't look anything like this but well we work with what we have</p>

<h2>ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>instant coffee (granules? i use international roast)</li>
    <li>condensed milk</li>
</ul>

<h2>steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>boil water</li>
    <li>add 2 moderately heaped tea spoons of coffee into a mug</li>
    <li>add a generous teaspoon of condensed milk into mug (i like it best when it's just taken out from the fridge, so a little thicker consistency than if it's been sitting outside)</li>
    <li>pour hot water into mug (about 5/6ths?? not to the brim bc again you don't want it to be too diluted...)</li>
    <li>stir enthusiastically and drink!!</li>
</ol>
